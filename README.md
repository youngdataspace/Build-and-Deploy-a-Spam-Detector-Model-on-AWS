# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Classifier + Deployment on AWS Cloud Servers
In this post, we will build a spam message classifier and deploy it. First, we will train and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model locally. Once we are satisfied with our model, we will deploy it on AWS using SageMaker. 

This repository contains all the codes necessary to replicate the contents in <a href = "https://medium.com/@y.s.yoon/artificial-neural-network-ann-classifier-deployment-on-aws-cloud-servers-405254909161">this blog post</a>.

# Part 1 - Build a spam classifier locally (spam_classifier.ipynb)
## Data
We are going to train our model using UCI Machine Learning's SMS spam collection dataset available <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset">here</a>.
